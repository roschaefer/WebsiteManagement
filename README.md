WebsiteManagement
=================

My brother who designs and styles static websites asked me: "Is it possible to have a simple parent web application where I can host the current state of my work and grant my clients access to their dedicated websites?"

I said: "Sure it's possible. I will try to create such a web application with _Ruby on Rails_"

And this is my solution to it.
